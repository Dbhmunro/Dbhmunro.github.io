My journey to this current time has been one that has been directed by a few key factors, the culmination of which has me excitedly and intensively pursuing a career in software engineering.

*Family*

In my life I have always been surrounded by computer programmers, but none were as ever-present and influential as my mom. During my younger years my mom taught herself computer programming. At the time she was an engineer working for the city, but she had been introduced to computer programming through her brother. Finding that she had a natural affinity for the subject, she began to spend much of her time reading different available texts and experimenting on her own time. Her exploration into the field of software engineering also became my earliest exposure to the work of software engineering. My mom’s drive to teach herself led to a career change when the city created a software engineering division within their engineering department.

From then through today, the two of us often find ourselves discussing some of the logic of her programs and working through the debugging at other times. It was through these ongoing discussions with her that I found that I also enjoyed the concepts behind programming, and ultimately found my initial love for software engineering.


*University*

During university, I was determined to pursue a life in the biological field, initially veterinary medicine and later biochemical research. Even with my focus on the biological sciences, I decided to include a study of C++, which I enjoyed so much that I found a way to squeeze in an additional course over the summer to study Java. Though I never did change my degree, the joys of my experience with working through problems of ever increasing complexity and creating interactive programs always stayed with me.


*Post-graduation*

The timing of my graduation in 2009 was not very conducive to pursuing a career in biochemical research, as research positions were slow to recover after the economic crash. This, however, set me on a path that allowed me to pursue a variety of interesting jobs across three different countries—U.S., Israel, and Switzerland. As I moved through these different jobs though, I found myself always gravitating towards aspects of the job that involved technical computer-based work.

The job in Israel had the greatest influence on steering me onto a path towards software engineering. While there, I was working as a correspondence editor/writer for the Baha’i World Centre. In my fourth year, the Baha’i World Centre began working with Accenture, a large technology-consulting firm, in developing a case management system that would be able to replace a collection of four different programs that were being used in our workflow. I was then asked to be part of the team that was working full-time with this project due to my familiarity with the workflow and ability to grasp the technical concepts.

During this project, I assisted in the requirements gathering phase and was involved in the meetings of the design phase. Following these periods, I was asked to work with two others in developing testing for the various parts of the program as it was being developed. This also involved in the end also overseeing a team of people in running these tests. Subsequent to the development of the program, I was also involved in the training of the staff in using this program, which allowed me to see more broadly how people responded to different features and functions of the program. This entire time period gave me a deeper appreciation of software development and re-awoke my desire to pursue software engineering.

Six months following the development of the final deliverable, we had received the rights to begin in-house customization of the program. During this, I was involved in the requirements gathering and was a primary point of contact for user feedback on customizations. Additionally, being close friends with the developers there, I was able to sit down with them often while they worked on the project. The involvement with this software development project served as the final push that I needed to put in motion plans to begin my study of software engineering.
