Starting your first coding project can be a bit intimidating, particularly on trying to figure out how to best start. These have been my experiences and insights from tackling my first project.

**Plan Ahead**

Though I knew of the importance of this step and did try to dedicate time to this portion of building my first application in my coding boot camp (Flatiron), I found that there were still some details that I needed to incorporate into my planning phase. Thinking of the menus and the user path through the program allowed me to have a clean framework to the program that I was building and helped me also identify what information I would need to feed my program and what inputs I'm looking for from the user.

However, what I learned would be helpful to incorporate in my future planning process is wording and nomenclature. I realized that I would need to dedicate time to properly wording my menus, navigation, and labels for information. This would need to be drafted from the outset, otherwise programming syntax would begin to creep into my menus. Before I realized it, the menus and navigation that I had written in later stages of the program (which made perfect sense to me) were actually confusing to someone who doesn't understand programming. Requests for user input had stilted wording, and options in the menus were similarly named to variables I was using. Leaving me wondering if I had ever written in proper English before.

Speaking of variables though, I found that their names also needed to be better planned ahead of time, particularly since I invested the time to figure out what information I would be storing in my program. Though the variables on a whole made sense to what they were referring to, there was sometimes subtle and confusing changes to the names of variables holding similar data. For example the differences between “electricity_access” and “access_to_internet”.

This however fell short of the challenges brought about by overlooking some of the basic questions about the application. Questions such as, “What is the purpose of this application?” and “Who would be my users?”.

Due to not considering this information at the beginning, I found the scope of my application growing rapidly as I continued to work on resolving these questions. Choosing to add new data to address what I actually want a user to be able to get out of using the application, and reworking menus to accommodate expanding options and new views.

This brings me to realizing something I really want to learn about for future projects is scalability. Yes, this does seem to be a staple of what many employers are interested in as part of one’s skillset. But this interest is far beyond the question of employability; it would be of interest for me, as I am excited by the prospect of being able to easily build in new functionality and options in future applications over time. So if there are tips on good resources for learning about writing scalable code, or even with respect to this project, how to write scalable CLI application menus, I would be very interested to hear about them in the comments.

**Learning to Code**

The exciting thing with every project is what you get to learn along the way. The first big learning for me was how to set up a project with all of the relevant files. Thankfully this course and the internet are rife with useful write-ups and videos on how to tackle many of the initial challenges one can come across in programming.

The next jump in learning for me was developing my first application that was in object oriented programming. My bit of previous programming knowledge focused on functional programming instead of object oriented. So, working in this programming paradigm was new and interesting to me and, admittedly, very enjoyable. Though this project didn’t have the level of complexity to necesitate intricate class relationships. Working with instances of a class to store data and work with it was a very natural and helpful way to group information.

Despite the lack of intricate classes, I did have many various methods I was calling upon. So, modules became a very helpful tool to group my different methods I was working with. This allowed for me to add a logical structure to the code, which will hopefully improves its readability for others.

Throughout this project I would build out a new feature and then test if it is working as intended before moving to the next. However all of my testing happened through re-running my program, and using my debugging tool (pry) to understand what was happening. However, what I would like to do is learn better how to write tests, so that I can more effectively code via test driven development.

Hopefully I will be able to share some insights to the questions raised herein after my next project.
